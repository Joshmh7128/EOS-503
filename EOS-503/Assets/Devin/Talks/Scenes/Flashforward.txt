Diana Davila:So. That's how it happened?
Diana Davila:[expression=2]Hm... Quite a tale you've woven for us.
Sam Hawkins:Sounds like more than you bargained for.
Sam Hawkins:[expression=2][They pause for a second, seemingly lost in thought.]
Sam Hawkins:[question=why]Just for curiosity's sake... one last question: why go to all that effort? What was your motivation?
[choice=Success]I was striving for success.
[choice=Fun]I wanted to have some fun.
[choice=Spontaneity]Honestly, I hadn't given it much thought.
Sam Hawkins:[expression=2]Hmm. Interesting.
Sam Hawkins:Thank you. That will end our inquiry.
Diana Davila:Captain Hawkins, do you now feel confident proceeding with Plan AC?
