Noah Tran:G'day, Athina-- sorry, but we were here first.
Athina Stamea:[expression=3]Step off, Noah. You aren't worth my time.
Puran Chuan:Noah, Athina, can't we just wait for the elevator in peace for once?
[As soon as they notice that the elevator door is open, the three groups arguing all rush forward towards you, jostling and pushing each other out of the way, and into the wall panels.

[In this process, you hear the shattering and breaking of critical parts that make the elevator function as many of the screens start to go dark.]
Athina Stamea:[expression=3]ARGH. This is all your fault, Puran!
Puran Chuan:[expression=3]What are you talking about? It was Noah!
Noah Tran:[expression=3]Ay, Puran, the bloody elevator's rooted because of <i>you</i> two!

Gabriel Broderson:Hello! You must be that DATA Agent the High Council informed us about! I'm Gabriel Broderson, the Workers' Representative to the High Council!
Gabriel Broderson:Here, we believe work is an essential part of life, that one must learn to contribute to the workforce to keep society productive! 
Gabriel Broderson:I am tasked with inviting you to 503-A, the Workers' Hold, to meet with Governor Rheegan. She is expecting you soon-- efficiency may as well be her middle name, so I wouldn't keep her waiting. See you soon!
