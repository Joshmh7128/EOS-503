Noah Tran:G'day, Athina-- sorry, but we were here first.
Athina Stamea:[expression=3]Step off, Noah. You aren't worth my time.
Puran Chuan:Noah, Athina, can't we just wait for the elevator in peace for once?
[As soon as they notice that the elevator door is open, the three groups arguing all rush forward towards you, jostling and pushing each other out of the way, and into the wall panels.]

[In this process, you hear the shattering and breaking of critical parts that make the elevator function as many of the screens start to go dark.]
Athina Stamea:[expression=3]ARGH. This is all your fault, Puran!
Puran Chuan:[expression=3]What are you talking about? It was Noah!
Noah Tran:[expression=3]Ay, Puran, the bloody elevator's rooted because of <i>you</i> two!

[title=gabriel-intro-start]
Gabriel Brodersen:[expression=1]Hello! You must be that DATA Agent the High Council informed us about! I'm Gabriel Brodersen, the <color=green><b>Workers'</b></color> Representative to the High Council!
Gabriel Brodersen:[expression=1]Here, we believe work is an essential part of life, that one must learn to contribute to the workforce to keep society productive! 
Gabriel Brodersen:I am tasked with inviting you to 503-A, the Workers' Hold, to meet with Governor Rheegan. She is expecting you soon-- efficiency may as well be her middle name, so I wouldn't keep her waiting. See you soon!

Atefeh Riahi:[expression=1]Welcome, welcome! I hope you're not too tired from your trip, Agent! I am Atefeh Riahi, the <color=blue><b>Seekers'</b></color> Representative to the High Council.
Atefeh Riahi:While the Workers are all work and no play, <i>we</i> follow a path of self-actualization from which learning and doing bring out greatness in each of us. 
Atefeh Riahi:[expression=1]And now, it is my great pleasure to invite you to meet with Governor Biff in 503-B, the City of Seekers! He has pressing business with you, Agent. Please make your way there at your earliest convenience!

[title=solvey-intro-start]
Solvey Ottadottir:[expression=1]Hello and welcome to EOS-503, Agent! I am Solvey Ottadottir, the <color=red><b>People's</b></color> Representative to the High Council. 
Solvey Ottadottir:We pride ourselves on ensuring every individual voice is heard as part of community decision-making, and we take care that our children learn the fundamentals of democractic participation so they can contribute as well! 
Solvey Ottadottir:I am excited you are also to be included on these matters! Governor Duncan has asked that you join our next town hall meeting in 503-C, the People's Republic. You have some time until it starts, but please do come and share your voice!

[title=grumble-start]
Puran Chuan:[expression=2]Hmph. No wonder Duncan can't talk to the other governors.
Noah Tran:Oh well. Back to the ol' bludger, then... hope he doesn't chew me out.
Athina Stamea:[expression=3]Great, now I can't get my supplies. Ugh, back to the studio! I must prepare my new work with <i>meraki</i> in time for the showcase!

[title=min-su-intro-start]
Han Min-su:[expression=1]Hello and welcome to 503!
Han Min-su:I am Han Min-su, leader of the <b>Neutral</b> faction here in The Hub. I am sorry your arrival was met with such an ugly sight.
Han Min-su:[expression=4]I had hoped to welcome you better, but it appears that division between the factions runs far deeper than just the governors.
Han Min-su:In any case, I am thankful you are here, and I hope that you can help solve our problems-- perhaps bring harmony to the governors and their people. I fear it is the only way to make Commune 503 prosperous again.
Han Min-su:[expression=1]Let us move somewhere more comfortable to continue our conversation...
[title=min-su-intro-end]

[title=jan-enter-start]
Jan Hurwicz:[expression=2]Hold on, not yet. How can you be so sure this 'fixer' is up to the job?
Jan Hurwicz:I am Jan Hurwicz-- I manage the trade market between the factions. I need these idiots to stop feuding so my market can reopen, but I still have no trust in the High Council, nor their 'fixer' sent to settle things for us.
Jan Hurwicz:[expression=3]Truly, Han Min-su, you trust this person? What if they make things worse? Pfeh.
