speaker:Excuse my interruption, friends.
speaker:[expression=1]I am Hamadi, the manager of the <i>'Musafir'</i>-- the elevator that was just damaged.
speaker:[expression=2]I overheard your conversation with Jan, and if you could spare the moment I would appreciate your counsel on getting the <i>Musafir</i> fixed.[newtalk start=xxx-start break=xxx-end]

speaker:[expression=3]Today's squabble is not the first time we have run into problems with the <i>Musafir.</i>
speaker:In truth, it has been challenging to prioritize elevator maintenance over the years, and what with so many other duties, we have mostly focused on non-electronic issues-- wait times, weight limits, movement of contraband, that sort of thing.
speaker:[question=xxx][expression=2]I have no experience or staff with the specific maintenance and repair skills needed to get things moving in a timely fashion. Without them, I am at a loss for what to do. What would you recommend?
[choice=Find Examples of this Problem from Others]Not everyone will have the same experiences, so when having trouble with solving a new problem, try to find examples of the problem from others, and work through the problem with them. This should help you understand the process for fixing the problem.
[choice=Try to Fix it Yourself to Learn]The best way to get this fixed is to repair it yourself, and in the process, learn what works and what does not. With that you will build an understanding of how to solve this problem, and when it comes up again in the future you will be able to solve it quickly.
[choice=Search your Memory for Similar Experiences]While you say that you have no experience with this, try to search your memories for anything that might be related. You might find that experiences you have had can actually help you to solve this problem more than you might think!

speaker:[question=0xx][expression=2]I'm not sure you really understand. I have no experience with this problem, so I am at a loss for what to do next to fix this, and I hope you can give me a better idea than the last one.

speaker:[expression=3]I thank you for trying to help, but I don't think your suggestions will be of much use for me. 
speaker:I'll keep working on it, but while you are visiting the other Factions, see if you can find people with some experience who can actually help me.

[title=01x-start]
speaker:[expression=1]Interesting, get examples of this problem from others and work through the example with them to understand the process. 
speaker:[question=01x][expression=2]That sounds like a good start, but I still don't have the people needed to get this fixed up, and I don't have experience with repair myself.
[choice=Learn from Others and Store Memories to Fix It]If you learn about repairing this model of elevator from others then you can store that information in your memory and then use that to fix the elevator. Then whenever you need to fix this elevator again, you will be able to fix it easily.
[choice=Learn to Repair it Yourself]You need to practice repairing the elevator yourself to know how to fix it. Through continuous repair and practice you will know how the elevator works, and can just fix it whenever it is necessary!
[choice=Work With People from Other Factions]If you don't have the people then maybe I can help find them in other factions. Part of solving problems is identifying skills, and what each person brings to a team. If you do not have the skills, and it needs to be solved quickly, finding people with those skills is necessary!

[title=win-start]
speaker:[expression=1]Interesting! I think that may actually work!
speaker:[expression=1]Thank you so much for your help, I'll reach out to other elevator managers and see if they have any examples of this problem we can work through. While I do that, and assemble materials, try to find people in the other Factions to assist us!
