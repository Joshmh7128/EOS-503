speaker:Alright. The core of my issue is that recently I haven't been able to reconstruct much of anything my friends bring me.
speaker:[expression=3]With the Secretaries' push for efficiency, everyone is experimenting in our Hold, trying to make things run better, faster, stronger, but without taking the time to record the process or write it down. I love trying to dismantle and repair all these new toys, but I'm worried that if I go back to work, this would bleed over quickly.[newtalk start=xxx-start break=xxx-end]

speaker:[question=xxx]Without videos, blueprints, or notes to review first, I am not sure that I'll be able to keep doing what I love. So, got any ideas for how to approach this?
[choice=Find Other References]Creativity always has a foundation. You might want to try taking some time to find similar ‘toys' that have these resources for review. After examining those you should have more knowledge stored to help you.
[choice=Build From What You Know]I think you have the ability to fix all of these things; you can construct your knowledge of the new problems through observing the old ones. You know which problems need moving parts and which are immobile. You know how to fix engines and transmissions. Using your knowledge of those, you can come to an understanding of a fix for the problem.
[choice=Offer Rewards For Notes]But isn't it rewarding to fix each of these machines? Every time you see something go from broken to functional again it must give you a sense of satisfaction. Your environment would be more free of clutter therefore your life would be freer. Working outside of hours may be annoying at first but the work will get done. After that, you can do what you want.

speaker:[expression=3]It seems to me like you're describing jerry-rigging something together for a short term fix. It sounds like a waste of time and energy. That doesn't seem like a viable solution to the problem.[newtalk start=0xx-start break=0xx-end]

speaker:[expression=3]I don't know how long you have been doing your job but here when one thing gets fixed another broken thing just replaces it. No matter how much work I do over 24 hours, there will always be more to do. Additionally, more work over too many hours leaves me unable to work efficiently. For example, during the 15th hour of the day, I am making as many mistakes as I have fixed. No, that won't do.[newtalk start=0xx-start break=0xx-end]

speaker:I have only been given directions on how to fix some of the things given to me. If I have the information to fix it, I do it! The rest I really can't finish, so it doesn't get done.
speaker:[question=0xx][expression=2]At one point they had given me all the books and blueprints I needed to get this work done. But recently there have been new problems and I have received no instruction on how to do it. I am also not going to spend my time off going and finding that information. That's how this clutter problem has developed really.
[choice=Find Other References]I think that you can fix these things given you had time to do your research during the day. If I can convince Rheegan to give you time during hours to research the new issues and how to fix them would you work on the things in here? You would have the time and be able to put that information onto your hard drive or into your long term memory. You would even improve at your job!
[choice=Build From What You Know]I think you have the ability to fix all of these things; you can construct your knowledge of the new problems through observing the old ones. You know which problems need moving parts, which need to stay still. You know how to fix engines and transmissions. Using your knowledge of those, why not build a fix for the problem?
[choice=Offer Rewards For Notes]But isn't it rewarding to fix each of these machines? Every time you see something go from broken to functional again it must give you a sense of satisfaction. Having a clear room would make more space for you to live in. Your environment would be more free of clutter therefore your life would be freer for you to do the things you want. Working outside of hours may be annoying at first but the work will get done. After that, you can do what you want.

I don't have instructions on how to fix these things! I need to see directions and interpret them to be able to understand how to fix this stuff.
[choice=Compile and Store Notes]Given that you had time to do the research you could always find the information on a computer or in a library. Then you could save it to a flash drive until it becomes part of your long term memory. You can consider taking notes on the subjects as a means of processing it!
[choice=Consult With Others Online]The convenient part about living with the internet and computers is that you can ask people on online forums how to fix some of these things. Talk with others about your problems and they will help you understand how to fix these things!
[choice=Provide Incentives For Solutions]Perhaps you should seek out a reward system. Every time you find a solution to one of your problems you get to do a task of your choosing. This would make finding the solutions enjoyable!
