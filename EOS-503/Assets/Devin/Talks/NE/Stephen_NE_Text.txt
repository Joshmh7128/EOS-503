speaker:I do the same thing, e'ry day from dawn till dusk. I'm always cleanin' or organizin' others to keep the 'old spotless. I can't keep goin' like this, Fixer. I mean, I <i>can</i>, but with such a bland routine and no downtime, why <i>shouldn't</i> I throw in the towel an' laze about?[newtalk start=xxx-start break=xxx-end]

speaker:[question=xxx][expression=2]It's all so time consumin', borin', and inefficient. Repeatin' the same tasks over an' over. You'd think it would inspire ya to make things better, but it 'asn't 'ad that effect on me... Ah, sorry fer troublin' ya wit me problems. Though since you're 'ere... any thoughts on 'ow to address my woes? Askin' fer a friend.
[choice=Ideas From Experience]Doing the same things repeatedly can be a slog, but what if you do a bit of reframing? Instead of focusing on the individual tasks at hand, construct an identity around your role. You can synthesize past experiences as a Cleaner into new ideas and solutions capable of making this place cleaner and better organized than ever!
[choice=Learn From Media]Well, before negotiations finish, why not take the time to read or watch videos on expert cleaning strategies? Learn from media, store some new ideas for later, use them to come up with novel solutions to make things more efficient. Then you'll have plenty of time to relax without the administrators getting upset!
[choice=Identify Invariance]If the goal is to make cleaning and organizing faster, and more fun and efficient, you should experiment with different techniques to track similarities and differences in process and outcome. Once you identify invariance between strategies, you'll be able to work better in unique and complex situations!

speaker:[question=0xx][expression=2]I told ya, cleanin' and organizin' is time consumin', borin', an' inefficient. But repeatin' the same process over an' over 'asn't 'elped me build a better way. What else ya gotta say?

speaker:[expression=3]I'll jus' 'ave to keep thinkin' about all this meself. Still, it's nice 'avin someone like you around ta talk through it. Fer takin' the time, I'll come to whatever meetin' ya arrange with Rheegan and Simm. Just tell 'em ta let me know when it 'appens.

[title=01x-start]
speaker:[expression=1]Reframin'... not a bad idea! Instead of focusin' too much on the day-ta-day specifics, I can keep me eyes trained on the big picture.
speaker:[question=01x][expression=2]Even though that would 'elp me, I'm responsible fer organizin' others too, else I 'ave to pick up their slack. I doubt springin' a bunch o' procedures on 'em will go over well. 'ow should I be approachin' this?
[choice=Build Understanding through Practice]You're right that springing new ideas on them won't automatically lead to learning. Maybe you should tell them that you're consolidating old practices by combining and reframing them. That way, it's clear that you'll be working together to build understanding through practice, not just putting pressure on them.
[choice=Application in Context]Simply giving everyone a new model won't be enough on its own. You should consider taking apprentices who can shadow you to learn skills in the context you want them applied. Eventually, you'll have a whole community of practitioners to experiment, teach, and work without your personal supervision.
[choice=Write a Manual]That would be startling! A better approach might be to write up a manual for storage first! Then you can give the manual to everyone else to read, they can then store that information in their long term memory. After that you won't have to pick up any slack.
