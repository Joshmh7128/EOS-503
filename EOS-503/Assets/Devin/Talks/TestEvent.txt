speakerName:<i>The artist traces one of their lines again; they reward themselves with a grape and smile.</i>

[choice]Don't think of it as a loss! Think of it as things that can help other people become whole. They can physically hang your work in their home, becoming part of their daily life. Seeing it regularly would help them achieve their ideal decor and self.
